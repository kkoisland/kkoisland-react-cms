October 23, 1994<br>
<br>
There was a Buddhist Priest in a temple.  He lived with four apprentices.  Every night he preached to the apprentices.  The apprentices were eager to understand what he said.<br>
<br>
One day, the Priest felt one of the apprentices was something strange.  He looked like he was afraid of one thing.  So he asked the apprentice.  But the apprentice asked the Priest not to ask anything.  On the next day, another apprentice was changed.  The Priest couldn't understand, but the apprentice was also afraid of something and asked him not to ask anything with crying.  After the day, all of apprentices became to be afraid and something strange.<br>
<br>
The temple had a long passage to a bathroom.  Behind the bathroom, there was a tomb.  Actually, all other tombs were located far from the temple.  But the tomb was different and even the priest didn't know why it was there.<br>
<br>
One day, the priest heard some noise in the mid-night.  On the day he didn't care about it.  But he heard the noise at same time every night.  He decided to make
sure what the noise was.  On the next day, when I heard the
noise,  he went the place of noise. To his surprise, all
apprentices went to the tomb and they looked like they were no
spirits.<br>
<br>
It was strange, so the priest decided to look into the tomb before they went on the next day.  When he went outside and started to see,,,, "Wahhhhh-----!"  He fainted.<br>
<br>
When he found himself in the morning, he noticed one spot on his back.  He went to the doctor, but the doctor said, "It is a bad sign.  You couldn't live long any more."<br>
<br>
The priest went back to the apprentices and told them about himself.  They were surprised and told him all of them had the same spots on their back after they looked at the tomb at mid-night.  They cried and cried.<br>
<br>
But at this time, they decided to dig out the tomb at noon.  There was a human's body under the tomb.  The body had been killed one hundred years ago.  All of them understood the dead body could not die because of his strong grudge.  The priest held the service from bottom of his heart.<br>
<br>
After this day, the spots went out from all of them gradually.  And they could live for a long time.<br>
