November 7, 1994<br>
<br>
When I was a junior high school student, I joined a table tennis club.  Thought I liked to play outside, my body was weak because I had asthma.  I wanted to be strong.  One day, I heard that a boy who had been asthmatic was cured after joining a table tennis club.  Therefore, I decided to join the club.<br>
<br>
At that time, it was common for all students who joined clubs to train hard.
Nowadays, I hear that students should go to more school after school, so they can not spend time for the clubs like before.<br>
<br>
However, in my ages, I had to train in the table tennis club from 3:00pm until 7:00pm every day.  It was very hard for me.  The contents of training were running for 2 hours, 100 doing push-ups and 100 sit-ups, 100 back-ups 100 squat thrusts every day.  After I finished these exercises, I could have played with my racket and ball.  My mother told me that I came back home for just sleeping.  Actually, after I went back home, I studied until mid-night.  In addition, I had to run for 1 hour every morning before school.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't remember how I could do these hard exercises with studying.  If I do the same exercises now, I will die.  Sometimes, I hated the exercises but I did them; as a result, my asthma was cured.  I became strong and healthy.  I realized that the exercises were too hard for students, but I have a strong body now. <br>
