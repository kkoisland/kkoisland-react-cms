<br>
The important person for me is a Japanese translator from English into Japanese in many books in Japan, Yumiko Taniguchi.  I knew her in her published books before I met.<br>
<br>
Actually, I met her two years ago.  Our common favorite books are the series of <b>A Little house on Prairie</b> by Laura Ingalls Wilder.  She organizes a fan club of it in Japan and I joined it.  The member are more than 300 people all over Japan. As I knew that her house is near my house, I asker her to help.  It is the first contact with her.  I became a stuff of the club, <b>Little House Club</b>, with other members.<br>
<br>
Through the club, she has a lot of influence to me.  She is a very independent woman as both a translator and a house keeper.  Sometimes it is hard for her because the time is limited, but she works every time powerfully and positively.  I liked to see her and to talk with her.  I learned many things from her.<br>
<br>
When I decided to come here to study English, she was very pleased with me.  Actually, I decided it because of her life style.  She is my ideal woman and I wanted to live like her in the future.  Though she already has a lot of knowledge, she is still diligent.  As she went abroad studying twenty years ago, she gave me much advice, and told me that there is no time to start studying again but every time is good if someone wants.  The word was very encouragement for me because I was afraid of my age, 29.<br>
<br>
She is the ideal person in my life, and I want to learn more from her even if we are far apart.  But I should remember she is my friend as she told me always.<br>
