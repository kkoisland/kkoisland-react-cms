I love the changes in all seasons.  I think they are a good qualities of my country.  The reason I decided to come here was the seasons of New York State.  I am very glad to have seasons here.  I remember my friends in Japan in each season.<br>
<br>
In the spring, school starts in our country with cherry blossoms.  After a hard, dry winter, we can enjoy ourselves outside.  In Japan, we call it "Hanami," a flower viewing, to watch and enjoy the cherry blossoms with friends or coworkers.  The lives of the flowers are short, usually one week or ten days, so the places are crowded at this time.<br>
<br>
In the summer, it is very humid in Japan. The crowds of the swimming pools and sea are terrible.  When I went to sea, I used to leave my house at 3:00 in the morning to park the car and get a good place for my belongings.  Also, it was very hard to find a good place where there were no people when we went camping.  But in spite of the difficulty in finding the place, we enjoyed every time we went camping.  For the Japanese, we are used to being crowded.<br>
<br>
Leaves turning red and yellow in the fall are very beautiful here.  Though we can see any place around our house, I used to go to find more good places with my friends or family.  Fall is my favorite season.  Actually, it is a good time to do everything, such as reading, eating excising, talking and staying up late at night.  After unbearably humid summer, we are comfortable in the fall.<br>
<br>
In the winter, I used to go skiing.  I love to ski.  It is not easy to go to the ski resort because it is far from our town; usually, it takes more than 8 hours by car.  However, after enjoying music and conversation in the car, the places are very beautiful and we enjoy skiing every time.  The winter is not so cold, but very dry.  It causes many colds, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Through all the seasons, we have some events.  I like them.  They are a good chance to make sure our own culture is nice.  But nowadays, people easily forget celebrating the events because of our busy schedules.  I regret it.<br>
