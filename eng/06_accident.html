<br>
I have had terrible accidents twice.  Actually, they are serious but something funny.  I wounded my face.  It was the right side next to my eye.  I did it twice on the same spot.<br>
<br>
When I was 18 years old, I used to ride a bicycle on my way to school every day.  One day, when I went back home, a woman came across my way.  She was in a hurry to cross the road while there was a blue signal though it was turning from yellow to red.  I tried to avoid her, but I couldn't.  As a result, I fell off from the bicycle and my face fell right on the ground.  I went to a hospital.  The doctor said I shouldn't have a suntan for one year. But I went to beach during the next summer.  I got a light brown mark beside my right eye.<br>
<br>
When I was 22 years old, I wounded the same spot again.  This time, it was a tragedy.  I jogged in the morning and fell down.  I remember that I couldn't understand why I fell down.  It was Sunday so all the hospitals were closed.   I can't forget the day because I should have attended a wedding ceremony where I was supposed to make a speech for the bride.  Later, I went to the hospital and the same doctor told me not to get suntan. However, of course(^^;, I went to beach in the next summer. I couldn't help going to beach.<br>
<br>
I know that I fall down easily.  Actually, I went to the same hospital several times from 17 to 23 years old.  The doctor remembered me well, and he said, "You come here every year."<br>
