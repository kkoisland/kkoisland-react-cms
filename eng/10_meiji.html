<b>MEIJI ERA (1869-1915)</b><br>
<br>
<b>Introduction : </b><br>
<br>
I would like to talk about during the disruption of EDO ERA (1603-1867) to MEIJI ERA (1869-1915) as one of an important time in Japan.  National ISOLATION was a Japanese characteristic and was also unique experience at a time of international.  Japan didn't communicate with any countries except Holland in Edo ERA for two centuries.  After this period, Japan changed quickly to modernize.  It is important to know MEIJI ERA to explain about Japan in today.<br>
<br><br>
<b>1. Rapid Technological advances in Europe</b><br>
At the beginning of the 19th century, Western industrialization, that is, steam powered ships with Perry in America forced Japan to put Isolation to an end.  They needed water and coal for their ships on their way to China trade.  In fact, for us, it meant the collapse of the Edo ERA and the start of the MEIJI ERA.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Political Change</b><br>
In the Edo ERA, Samurai was absolutely right.  When Samurai killed an English man who walked across Samurai's way, Westerners accused the Japanese government.  Samurai also complained to the government.  Gradually, the Japanese Tokugawa government had lost their confidence and power.  At last, the Centralized feudalism was ended and the leadership of the Imperial forces was started.  Samurai who had strong power based on Centralized feudalism, were weak and disappeared at last.  By the name "expel the barbarians (Westerners)," new systems and a new government started and they founded the Japan of today.<br>
<br>
<b>3. The Great Change</b><br>
There are several points of change as follows :<br>
<br>
<b>Technological modernization : German model</b><br>
<br>
<b>Agriculture : American model</b><br>
<br>
<b>Government : German model</b><br>
They hadn't had the concepts and practices of democracy.  So they are easy to accept the Western democratic system.<br>
<br>
<b>Education : French model</b><br>
Basically, non religion and equalized system.  First foreign language should be English.  People were taught from Protestant missionaries of the United States.<br>
<br>
<b>Business</b><br>
There are mainly two elements.<br>
1) Government sold industrial produces to the enterprises to make money for rapid changes.<br>
2) Samurai sought new ways to make a living.  As they had connections with government, many of them succeeded.<br>
These are the raising enterprises.<br>
<br>
<b>Characteristic and Thinking</b><br>
Homogeneity and self-identity because there was no chance to invade by foreign people. The change was justified because there was no time to think deeply.<br>
<br><br>
<b>4. Closing</b><br>
In only 20 years, almost all Japanese systems were settled.  Clearly, they were realistic and pragmatic experimentations.  Though it is said that they were almost succeeded, there are no dreams and no recklessness.<br>
