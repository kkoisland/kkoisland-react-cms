The Gurico-Morinaga case happened more than 20 years ago in Japan. It 
scared all Japanese at that time. When the G-M case occurred, nobodyhad ever heard of anything like it.<br><br>Things started when the president of the Gurico company, which is oneof the big confectionary companies, was kidnapped by someone.  Thegroup that carried him off called themselves "Kaijin 21-menso". Thisname is radicurous because it came from an old mystery book, "Kaijin20-menso," who always trick the police.  Actually Kaijin 21-menso madefun of the people who were serious about the case, such as the policeor the exective of the company. They sent redicurous statement thatthey did it because they got bored.  Fortunately, the president cameback without any injury.<br><br>Their pattern was clever and well-planned compared with their childishwords.  Police couldn't solve this case or even how many people therewere in Kaijin 21-menso.  Moreover, K-21 sent another statement to thepolice that said they would continue to make fun of us - people inJapan - more and more.<br><br>The next target was the Morinaga Confectionary Company.  To the bestof my memory, they asked a large amount of money from the company,they started to scare us when Morinanga refused.<br><br>They decided to put potassium cyanide into the products ofconfectionary companies and the consumer would have been killed ifhe/she had eaten the contarminated products.  K-21 didn't say whichcompany was their target, but they sent a statement to the police thatthey would do this to some Japanese big companies.<br><br>Nobody could do anything.  If the police had not announced to theJapanese people, many people would have died from the poison, but itonly confused the public when they were informed. The police and thecompanies had no clues to the mystery.  The announcement only madepeole stop buying the major companies' confectionaries - cakes, cook,candies, snack-food.<br><br>the companies made special wraps which showed everybody knows if theconfectionary had been opened before. This was the only thing thecompany could do.  However, we were surprised that they changed thewraps from the old ones very quickly.  We usualy think that Japanesecompanies are very slow to do some things, especially things which arenot for their own benefit.  So, we found out that they can do thesekind of things if they try.<br><br>Anyway, nobody was arrested, although some criminals who used theirname, because victims were afraid when they heard the name "Kaijin21-menso", were arrested.<br><br>Actually, the police had one chance to catch them when the grouppassed through a police checkpoint.  A camera station at a point onthe highway had required them as they drove through, but did notcommunicate to the ceckpoint station, therefore, the police did notcatch them.  The public found out about this when K-21 wrote a letterto a newspaper, telling them that they had been stopped at thecheckpoint but they let go.  The chief of police commited sucide thenext week after he and the department were blamed for this incident.<br><br>One day, one store caught a man in the secrity camera.  His eyes werevery thin, so everybody called him "Kitsune-me no Otoko(a man with foxeyes)."  The police tried to find him and the group, but they neverfound him or the group. K-21 finally sent a message to the public thatthey would not scare us any more because they get bored to keep doingthis.<br><br>By the way, the term "Kitsune-me no Otoko" was getting popular amongJapanese, and everybody started to use it in the conversation. Itfinally got the prize as the most popular word of the year.  Later, wediscovered that many well-known people who have thin eyes werecontacted and interrogated by the police regarding the case.  At thesame time they sometimes get into trouble by looking susicious tobystanders.<br>
