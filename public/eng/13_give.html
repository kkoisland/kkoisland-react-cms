My grandmother used to say, "The most important thing to communicate with someone is to give than to receive."<br>
<br>
I didn't like too kind people because they always lose something for some cunning people.  Therefore, I didn't like to give than to receive.<br>
<br>
However, when I was in my adolescence, I had many bad experiences.  I noticed losing person is always losing, and receiving person is always receiving.  Furthermore, when I gave something, I always irritated it.  I really hated to irritate myself and I should stop giving anything to anyone if I wanted to avoid it.  Yet it is too selfish and it means that I will get loneliness to give up communicating with anyone.<br>
<br>
One day, I changed my mind. I decide to carry out my grandmother's word.  At that time, I didn't have any good idea, so I had no way except accepting the word.  Later on, I noticed that I could do everything in a good way.  I didn't irritate any more because it was my promise to myself.  To my surprise, when I give something, most of them give me back.  They were sensible people, though I hadn't noticed about it when I irritated myself.<br>
<br>
Afterward, I keep the word.  Now I completely understand what my grandmother said.  She passed away several years ago.  Most of my memories to her are that I didn't accept her.  Though the word always helps me from my bad situation, it remind me of the bitter treatment to her, at the same time.<br>
