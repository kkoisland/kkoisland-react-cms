Hi, that's me! I went to the "Wappingers Falls" about one hour from my town. When I found a postcard of "Wappingers Falls," I wonder how big the falls are... However, I was surprised that it was so small. It might be the smallest ones which I've ever seen in my whole life. (^^;  <br>
<br>
I have been here since <b>in August, 1994</b>. I came from Japan. I had worked in a computer company <b>as a secretary for 6 years</b> before I came here. When I was 29 years old, I quit my job and started to study at ESL, <b>English as a second language</b>, here. Since I worked in a computer company, I was interested in studying about computer for a long time in Japan; therefore, I took some courses for <b>computer science</b>. It was & is hard to study because my major was not in it; however, I am happy to take some computer courses since I was eager to do so. <br>
<br>
I started to access to the Internet in 1996. Though I was not interested in playing there at first, I gradually liked it. Then, I decided to make my own homepage, here! My computer is <b>IBM Think Pad 530CS</b> (CPU:Am5x86-133MHz, RAM:20MB, Modem:Mwave, HDD:720MB), which I bought in Japan (Japanese version) in June, 1996. <br>
<br>
Here, this is my favorite. <b>A little house on the Prairie</b> series written by <b>Laura Ingalls Wilder</b>. The TV program is also popular in Japan, not only in the United States, and I've loved the books since I was seven years old. I organize a fan club in Japan. We are about 400 people all over Japan. We have a newsletter twice in a year and exchange information about books or the series on TV. Here is <a href="http://www.vvv.com/~jenslegg/">the site</a>. If you have any information of it, please mail me!<br>
