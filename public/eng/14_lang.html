Though it is said that watching TV too much is not good for us, it is not bad to do in a foreign language.  If we are not interested in the language so much, we do not need to worry about it because we can not keep watching it for so long time.  But it we want to improve the language, there are some advantages for us.<br>
<br>
First, we can get practice in hearing the language.  As meeting people is limited in our lives, we could meet various people through watching TV.  When we turn on the news, there are the anchors who speak correctly and clearly.  We can learn the typical word forms from them. When we watch some stories, movies or talk shows, the people who are up there are precious to help understanding conversation and some dialect in the country.  Actually, though listening is difficult for foreigners, we can reduce the suffering if we could keep watching with enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Second, the merit to watch TV in a foreign language is to learn the ways in the country such as manners, character, any other specialties.  For example, one country has many jokes from their own characteristic in TV; another always has serious programs because it is a developed nation.  One type is those who speak friendly almost all the time;  another type is those who always speak without smiling because of the tradition of the country.<br>
<br>
In addition, it is easy to be informed about the current information in the world.  Of course, we could know the facts from the news, also, we see the thinking of the governments and movements in the world.  From some discussion programs we realize each opinion of the people who engage in each organization.  Furthermore, sometimes each generation understands each other over their nationality and sometimes it encourages us to go our own ways.<br>
<br>
To conclude, TV is a good means for us if we could use it in a good way.  When we watch TV to progress with a foreign language, it brings various profits to our lives.<br>
