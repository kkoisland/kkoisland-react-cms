When I think about the pace between America and Japan, I don't know which is fast and which is slow.<br>
<br>
In supermarkets or shops, the clerks are very fast to do anything in Japan.  When we buy something, they fold the things and change the money in a hurry way.  I worked in McDonald's when I was a student.  I learned to do quickly with good manners.  We shouldn't have a customer wait more than half an minute, so we should run in a small area to bring the foods which the customer ordered.  If we had the person wait, we had to apologize. On a contrary, American clerks are very slow.<br>
<br>
However, when someone ask something, Americans request our answer quickly.  Generally, they have a good decision.  For example, when someone asked me to go out the next weekend, I should have answered on the time.  But Japanese don't need the answer so quickly in general.  They give me time to think and make sure my mind.<br>
<br>
So I don't know which is fast and which is slow.<br>
