I like to watch movies.  When I go to the theater, I like to see the life of a leading character along with laughs, loves and tears in the movie.  I like to see a difference between the movies and my life, and I like the movies to be interesting.  I want to see various kinds of movies and many parts of life.  Movies sometimes make me feel happy, and sometimes make me feel solemn.  I know that some of them are worthless to watch.  However, I often go to the cinemas and try to look for some things in which I am interested.<br>
<br>
I often watch American movies as well as Japanese ones.  Because there is a huge number of movies in the world, I cannot choose one to watch without listening to the advertisements before I got to the movies.  When I watched the advertisement for "The last of the Mohicans,"  it said that you would be impressed by the story which is a sorrowful and beautiful story about the last day of one tribe.  I was interested in it because we have few kinds of tribes in Japan.  I expected that they would show me a struggle with keeping their tradition to the fact of losing the tribe, and the woe of the Mohicans, who have to meet their last day.  However, I only saw a lot of action, fear and romantic love.  <br>
<br>
After that, I watched some others, including "The Fugitive," "True Lies," "Clear and Present Danger," "Time Cop," "Interview with a Vampire," and "Outbreak."  I liked some parts, and they were sometimes interesting.  However, I felt that they were quite similar, in spite of the different stories.  The reason is that all of them have romantic love and too much fearful action, which included someone running after another by airplane, and people fighting on a bridge, and so on.  In other words, they have dread, danger and an exciting escape from the danger.<br>
<br>
I like a romantic love story, such as the French Movie, "Hairdresser's Husband," or the Italian "Black Eyes."  I was impressed by these movies.  People usually experience many kinds of love in their lives, such as with parents, children, friends and so on.  And in these movies, the producers cut off these loves, and FOCUSED ON a romantic love.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, I remember that "ET" attracted many people without a romantic love.  I know that people tend to like fearful action and a romantic love story.  I think to FOCUS ON ONE THEME is important.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I have read articles and talked with friends.  They said that many people are also eager to watch another kind of movie from the ones which mix the aspects I've mentioned. <br>
<br>
People say that a good movie is art.  Therefore, I expect a movie to fascinate me while focusing on one theme.<br>
