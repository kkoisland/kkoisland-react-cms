A blonde gets on an airplane and sits down in the first class section. The stewardess tells her she must move to economy because she doesn't have a first class ticket.<br>
<br>
The blonde replies, "I'm blonde, I'm smart, I have a　good job and I'm staying in first class until we reach　Jamaica."<br>
<br>
The stewardess gets the head stewardess who asks the woman to leave and she says, "I'm blonde, I'm smart, I have a good job and I'm staying in first class until we reach Jamaica."<br>
<br>
The stewardesses don't know what to do because they　have to get the rest of the passengers seated to take　off, so they get the co-pilot.<br>
<br>
The co-pilot goes up to the blonde and whispers in her　ear.  She immediately gets up and goes to her seat in　the economy section.<br>
<br>
The head stewardess asks the　co-pilot what he said to get her to move.<br>
<br>
The co-pilot replies, "I told her the front half of the　airplane wasn't going to Jamaica".<br>
