There was a party that many rich people attended. The host had
recently built a giant tank across his estate filled with many
alligators, piranhas, and other man-eating creatures.

The host said that if anyone had the guts to swim across the tank,
he would, to the best of his ability, grant the person 3 wishes.
Well nobody was up to the challenge, so everyone just
started having a good time and doing that "party thing."

Suddenly, there was this big splash! The host looked and saw a
man swimming frantically across the tank, and, lo and behold, he
survived and made it across - just missing the snap of a crocodile!

The host walked over to the man and said, "That's incredible,
you made it, You're crazy but incredible!"

"As I promised, I will honor your 3 wishes."

The man replied, "First, you see that shotgun of yours? Give me it."

"Second, see those bullets over there?   Give me them too,"

"And third, show me that jerk who pushed me in!"
